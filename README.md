**Description:** You need to create a gameplay clone of the Space Invaders game. The goal is to replicate the essence of the gameplay. Replicating graphics, assets, and sounds is optional and is at the discretion of the developer.

**Execution Requirements:**
- Unity 2021.3.4 LTS (Preferred)
- 2D or 3D (developer's choice)
- Assets can either be self-drawn or taken from the Asset Store
- Sound is optional and will not be evaluated

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **3:** The game launches, and the gameplay resembles the original game. Includes shooting, movement of the character and enemies, and damage application.
- **4:** Criteria for 3, plus a scoring and player lives system implemented. Visual assets are in a consistent visual style.
- **5:** Criteria for 4, plus well-structured and aesthetically pleasing code and project architecture. Upon the death of certain enemies, a falling power-up drops, which temporarily enhances the character (increased movement speed, additional projectile when shooting, or other enhancements at the developer's discretion).

**Submission Format:** Link to Git repository and in-person presentation.
